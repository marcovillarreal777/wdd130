                            - [ ] Heard the song "shuniji" by c418 at a coffee shop and had the idea for this song. I dont know, sometimes when making a song I get into like a sort of trance where I just do stuff without second guessing anything and its nice. I just chopped up the song a bunch in a way that I would not not be able to recreate. I think I put some random drum loop over it at first that didnt fit at all then forgot about it for a week or so. When I got back to it I immediately created the drums you hear now then layered some loops underneath. AAAANYWAY not to overexplain everything but I finsihed the song over the next week or two and liked it a lot so I gave it a final mix and put it out.

                        For this track it’s been a long time coming for what seems like not that much. It’s only a little over two minutes long but the reason there has been such a gap between releases, is not just because of college. I have been experimenting a lot with what I’ve been making and really focusing on exclusively making all of my own melodies and compositions. I have been doing all of my own sound design and composition pretty much since nightfishing released and it’s been paying off. Every single sound you can hear in this song was designed by me. Ive been making a lot of progress behind the scenes and this is a small peek into what I’ve been up to recently. I hope to be able to put more of it out in the near future.

                        For this album it really only came out 5 months after I first started learning music production. At the time I had a decent amount of melodies that I had made trying to replicate the type of chill video game music that I like. I have been mainly inspired by the Donkey Kong soundtracks and other music like that. I took a short break from production on a trip to New York City to visit my older brother. After this break I came back and relentlessly worked on break core, drum and bass, and jungle music, when that was not really what I was making previous to that. During this time I didn’t make a single new melody. I found songs I liked around the internet, sampled them and added what I felt would sound good. If it didn’t immediately sound good I gave up on the sample and moved on to another one. There were points I was making 4 demos a night and I have upwards of 40 throwaways from this 15 song project. When I tell people that they tend to not really believe me but its true. The catch however is that many of them were only worked on for a short time before I realized it wouldn’t work and moved on. Toward the end of the project I went back and sampled many of my own melodies and put 5 of those on the project. I would add different mixes of delays, reverb, flangers, filters, and whatever else to make the melodies of what I sampled more psychedelic and entrancing. I feel like the development of this record was very quick as I believe it only took about 2 months. I moved to college when almost done with the project and simply tweaked all of the songs until I liked them and uploaded for release a few weeks into my freshman fall semester. Overall I think that the record is pretty good for a drum and bass record, and I tried my best at the time but I know that in all aspects I could do better now.

                        This is a much more forgotten track that I’ve put out. I hardly remember that it exists most of the time when thinking about my releases. Main reason for that is that I made it in about a day or two. The sample is a piano piece from the movie Twilight which is why I named it that obviously. I had just finished watching that movie at my older sister’s house and just thought to sample the song. I did and liked the way it turned out so I just put some finishing touches on it when I got back to my house and uploaded it. Its crazy seeing how different my music got after this release but there’s still something about it that I like even though its not something I ever recommend people to check out.

                        - [ ] Even though the melody on this is much more repetitive than I would ever make today there is something very nice about this one. Its definitely the closes song I’ve put out to a Donkey Kong soundtrack song. I really enjoy the chillness and simplicity of it now and feel very inspired to make something better with the knowledge and skills I have now. I’m thinking of remaking this song and a now deleted song and rereleasing them. Some interesting sound design, psychedelic mixing, and improved drums could really bring this one to the next level. It can be good to just move on though, otherwise I would just remaster everything.
