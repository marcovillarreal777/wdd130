                        This weekend was my first time being able to visit Utah and my friends in Utah. The highlight of the weekend was definitely being able to see Metro Boomin live. Looking at his Spotify, he is one of the most streamed artists in the world and has so many hits that I like and songs that he has produced. He DJed a 40 minute set at a super low-key bleacher report event. I got in the mosh pit with all of my friends and had a great time. It was actually so cool being able to see the man who has made so many of my favorite songs. The rest of the weekend was cool but just hanging around compared to that.
