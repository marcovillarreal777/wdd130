      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Because I am so self centered I want this page to simply just be all about me. I want people to have a good idea on who I am and what I do. After someone exits my page I want them to feel like they know me personally even if they have never spoken to me, and know what I am up so in the moment. I also want to update the website frequently in the future.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>When done with this website I will most likely be putting it in any of my social media bios, as well as my canvas. I want my peers or anybody interested enough to click on it to be able to see it. Especially with something I am putting my true self into, and being somewhat open and vulnerable in, its not something I want to force people to look at, but something people who are interested can really dive into. Overall I want this to be mainly for my peers to see.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        This page is going to be a short biography of me. What im up to right now, where I come from. All of my socials will be linked here and my most recent musical work or anything else I want to specifically highlight will be here too.

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        This is meant to be a section for me to showcase every piece of music that I have out right now. I am going to link the song/album and provide any related pictures. I also am going to write the story behind every song that I have out. I have experiences making every piece of music that I have out and I want the people that like the songs and support my music to know what really went into it.
        <br>
        ——————————<br>
        For example my album ‘Nightfishing’:<br>
        For this album it really only came out around 5-6 months after I first started learning music production. At the time I had a decent amount of melodies that I had made trying to replicate the type of chill video game music that I like. I have been mainly inspired by the Donkey Kong soundtracks and other music like that. I took a short break from production on a trip to New York City to visit my older brother. After this break I came back and relentlessly worked on break core, drum and bass, and jungle music, when that was not really what I was making previous to that. During this time I didn’t make a single new melody. I found songs I liked around the internet, sampled them and added what I felt would sound good. If it didn’t immediately sound good I gave up on the sample and moved on to another one. There were points I was making 4 demos a night and I have upwards of 40 throwaways from this 15 song project. When I tell people that they tend to not really believe me but its true. The catch however is that many of them were only worked on for a short time before I realized it wouldn’t work and moved on. Toward the end of the project I went back and sampled many of my own melodies and put 5 of those on the project. I would add different mixes of delays, reverb, flangers, filters, and whatever else to make the melodies of what I sampled more psychedelic and entrancing. I feel like the development of this record was very quick as I believe it only took about 2 months. I moved to college when almost done with the project and simply tweaked all of the songs until I liked them and uploaded for release a few weeks into my freshman fall semester. Overall I think that the record is pretty good for a drum and bass record, and I tried my best at the time but I know that in all aspects I could do better now.

      <h3>Blog</h3>
      <p>
        Going to be a place for me to put entries on whatever is going on
        in my life a the time, or whatever im interested int he moment. I will make two initial entries and continue to update it when I feel I should. Also a picture or two will always be attached to a post on there.
        <br>Two Examples. -------- <br>- [ ] 2/17/23-2/20/23 Weekend - This weekend was my first time being able to visit Utah and my friends in Utah. The highlight of the weekend was definitely being able to see Metro Boomin live. Looking at his Spotify, he is one of the most streamed artists in the world and has so many hits that I like and songs that he has produced. He DJed a 40 minute set at a super low-key bleacher report event. I got in the mosh pit with all of my friends and had a great time. It was actually so cool being able to see the man who has made so many of my favorite songs. The rest of the weekend was cool but just hanging around compared to that.
        <br>- [ ] 3/31/23 - Just started working on this website after being stupid and procrastinating all semester because I was scared of the work load. I leave Rexburg in a few days so this is probably the worst time to be trying to do the whole thing but I just have to put the work in and finish it. I am actually so unbelievably stressed right now and I’m praying that it can be counted as credit for me. Im putting in so much work, I will be devastated if I fail this class. Im finishing all of the work no matter what so even if I fail I can retake and just submit everything at the beginning of the semester for an easy 100.
