    <h2>Marco Villarrel</h2>
    <p> This is my second semester here at this college coming from Dallas Texas. Ive always liked computers, games, and wondered how they worked so this area of study felt like a no brainer.</p>
    <p> - I am majoring in computer science.</p>
    <p> - i enjoy making music and hiking in my free time.</p>
    <p> - I am not married and have no desire to ever have any stinky kids.</p>
    <p> - i do not currently have a job I am just a full time student.</p>
    <p> - The thing I love the most about BYU-I is the Ricks Garden.</p>
    <p> - Im taking the course to expand my coding knowledge and abilitys to forward my degree and career.</p>
    <p> - I was born into the church because my parents decided it and i do not have a favorite scripture.</p>
